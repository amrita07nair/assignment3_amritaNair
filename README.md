Hello! 
With the changes I made for the assignment. You may have to change out the trainset and testset root locations. I had to manually download CIFAR10 due to errors for some reason. You will have to manually download and change the root locations or change download to True in those spots.
I had a lot of technical issues with the root locations and train and test set stuff, but also, my anaconda jupyter kept crashing due to one line in the code (as you will see by my comments). I had to switch to using VS code through Ubuntu which avoided the problem.
